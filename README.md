Both physicians and patients can use the application. If you are a physician user and would like to create a new account, click the link "Physician Signup". You can create an account by filling out the signup form which requires a unique username, unique password, and 10 digit unique NPI number. Once logged in as a physician, you can add, edit, or delete your patients from your active list. You can also edit your patient's medical history and active problems. As a patient you can create an account by clicking "Patient Signup". You will create a new account with a unique username and password. Once logged in you can view your medical history and active medical problems. You can also add your blood pressure, heart rate, and day/time for yourself and your doctor to view.
This application promotes patient involvement in their care and allows physicians to manage their patients remotely outside of their daily workflow. The blood pressure and heart rate measurements can be used by doctors to monitor patient status and adjust medications. This feature can be used by patients to monitor their progress.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
