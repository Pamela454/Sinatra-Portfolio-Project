# Emr

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/emr`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: This gem allows physicians to manage patient lists and for patients to also view their
medical history and active medical problems.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'emr'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install emr

## Usage

TODO: 
To use the application, clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. Sign in as either a physician or a patient. If you are a first time physician user, you can create an account by filling out the signup form which gives the required data. Once logged
in as a physician, you can add, edit, or delete your patient list. You can also edit your patient's medical history and active problems. As a patient you will be granted access to your account by your physician through a username and password. This allows you to view your medical
history and active medical problems. This application promotes patient involvement in their care
and allows physicians to manage their patients remotely outside of their daily workflow. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
